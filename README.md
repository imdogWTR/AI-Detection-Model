# AI-Detection-Model
This project is meant to be deployed at construction sites to detect people without helmets on

  #### NEEDED SOFTWARE:
      - Python
<<<<<<< HEAD
      - jetson-inference
  #### USED DATASETS
  I used the OpenImages datasets for helmets and people to get the model to detect both people and helmets

  #### INSTALLATION
  MAKE SURE YOU HAVE PYTHON AND JETSON-INFERENCE INSTALLED ON YOUR COMPUTER \
  Download this repository in its entirety and place it anywhere

  #### RUNNING THE MODEL 
  Go to your linux terminal then cd into this repository and run python3 code.py
